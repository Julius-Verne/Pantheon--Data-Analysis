# Pantheon_Data_Analysis

Second Project of Udacity Data Analysis ND.

## The Data
I used the dataset created by the Macro Connections group of **MIT Media Lab**. 

The dataset has information about notable people on Wikipedia that have their biographies
translated to more than 25 languages. This dataset is a way to conmemorate and analyze our accomplishments as a species. :sparkles:

You can get more information on their [official site](http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/about/team) or their [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/mit/pantheon-project/data)
